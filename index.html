  <h1>Hashgraph Consensus Tutorial</h1>
  <p>An introduction to hashgraph consensus by Stefan Buhrmester</p>
  <h2>What is Hashgraph Consensus</h2>
  <p>
    The hashgraph consensus algorithm is a rather new algorithm that creates and maintains a
    consensus over the correct order of events that occur among several interconnected nodes.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is particularily useful when creating distributed systems that need to operate on a globally agreed
    state, such as log replication, distributed ledgers or shared databases.
  </p>
  <p>
    It operates without leader election, is optionally byzantine, runs in a dynamic environment, and depending on implementation can be very bandwidth-efficient.
